This is my first fully functional game that i've built using tutorials from Scrimba Free Javascript Tutorials.
But first,do you even know how to play Blackjack? Well i didn't. And i had to watch two quick tutorials before building this.
And, turns out it's a very fun game and worth recreating. So i did.
Enjoy!
